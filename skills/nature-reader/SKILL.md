# Full-Paper Markdown Reader — Router

<!-- OCSL-WRITING-RUNTIME -->
## Runtime in OC Science Lab

Primary environment: `writing-documents` (CPU). Use `ocsl-writing env run --environment writing-documents -- <command>`
from the selected chat workspace. `$OCSL_WRITING_HOME` names the read-only package
root; resolve `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` and shared-resource paths from
this installed skill, while outputs belong in the chat workspace. Never install
dependencies into the immutable template or assume an optional runtime is ready.
Default user-facing manuscripts, reports and slides to English; preserve requested
Chinese or bilingual workflows and source-language quotations.

Additional capabilities: browser rendering (optional).

Writing composes from supplied or verified evidence. Use the review companion for
independent evidentiary audits and the bio companion for biological analysis.
Record missing evidence and unavailable capabilities explicitly. Keep automated
checks distinct from human scientific verification. Existing user authorization
and deployment confidentiality/egress rules govern external services; a skill
does not authorize data transfer or require repeated approval for local drafting.

Local integration changes and original terms are recorded in `UPSTREAM.md`.

This skill is split into two layers:

- A **static layer** under `static/` that holds versioned, reusable content fragments (core principles, the reading workflow, the output contract, and per-source-format extraction guidance).
- A **dynamic layer** (this file plus `manifest.yaml`) that detects the request's source format and loads only the fragments needed for the current job.

Do not try to apply the reading logic from memory or from this router. Always load fragments from disk as described below.

## Routing protocol

Follow these five steps every time the skill is invoked.

### 1. Load the manifest and the core layer

Read [manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml). It declares the `source_format` axis, the allowed values, and the file paths each value maps to.

Also read every file listed under `always_load`. These hold the core principles, the reading workflow, and the output contract that apply to every reading job, plus the shared Terminology Ledger used to build the recurring-term table.

### 2. Detect the source format

Decide the `source_format` value using the manifest's `detect:` hint and the user's input:

- `pdf-text` — selectable-text PDF. Default.
- `scanned-pdf` — image-only or OCR-required PDF.
- `html` — publisher or preprint HTML page.
- `doi-arxiv` — a bare DOI or arXiv link that must be resolved first.
- `pasted-text` — pasted prose or notes with no retrievable original layout.

State the detected value in one short line to the user before processing, so they can correct you cheaply. A source may map to more than one value (for example a DOI that resolves to a PDF); load the resolution fragment first, then the fragment for the resolved artifact.

### 3. Load the matching fragment(s)

Read the file mapped for the detected `source_format`. Do **not** read every fragment in `static/`. Load only what step 2 selected.

### 4. Build the reader using the loaded material

Apply the loaded fragments in this priority order:

1. Core principles (`core/principles.md`) — bilingual reader by default, translate for meaning, never degrade to a summary, copyright caution.
2. Source-format fragment — how to extract text, figures, and tables for this input.
3. Reading workflow (`core/workflow.md`) — the six-step source-map-first process.
4. Output contract (`core/output-contract.md`) — required files and the pre-response verification checklist.

Build the Terminology Ledger as you translate (`../nature-shared/core/terminology-ledger.md`); it becomes the `paper.md` recurring-term table and the `source_map.json` glossary.

If constraints prevent full processing, still create a draft reader and label missing pages, figures, or low-confidence crops in `translation_notes.md`. Do not switch to summary mode.

### 5. Reach for references only when needed

The files under `references/` are deep references, not defaults. Open them on demand per the `references.on_demand` table in the manifest:

- detailed figure/table cropping and placement → `references/figure-extraction.md`.
- exact field schema for `paper.md` / `source_map.json` → `references/output-spec.md`.
- equations, mathematical expressions, chemical formulae, or image-only formulae → `references/equation-handling.md`.
- answering follow-up questions with source citations → `references/grounding-rules.md`.

## Why this split

- The static layer is versioned and reviewable. Adding a new source format is one new fragment plus one manifest line.
- The dynamic layer keeps each invocation cheap: only the fragment relevant to this input enters context.
- The router itself is short on purpose. Update fragments, not this file, when adding scope.
- This structure mirrors `nature-writing` and `nature-polishing` so shared content lives in `nature-shared/`.
